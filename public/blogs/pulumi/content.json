We are using Docker CLI to interact with Docker daemon. This process will take care of spawning child processes i.e. containers. Because of this, A single process could be a single point of failure.If failed, then there are orphaned processes. To make CRI lighter Kubernetes has removed Docker majorly because of this.</li><li><b>Docker becomes a paid subscription</b> for a large enterprise that has more than 250 employees or $10 million in revenue, starting at $5 per user per month. It is important to note that <u> Docker Desktop remains free for personal use, educational institutions, non-commercial open-source projects, and small businesses under the new Docker Personal plan</u>.</li><ul>"

Migration from Docker to these tools doesnt need much effort since it can understand Dockerfile and Docker commands ,  and these are done without Daemon in background. <ul><li><b>Buildah</b> is a lightweight tool that builds the images with OCI satndards without a daemon. It can pull images from Docker registry or <a href='https://quay.io/'>Quay.io</a> or any custom registry. You can use shell script or Dockerfile to build the images. </li><li><b>Podman</b> comes to run the image as containers and the same one, you do not need daemon process to start or manage a container. The commands you are familiar with in Docker work the same for Podman even u can change alias docker=podman in your system. You wont feel the difference. Podman uses Buildah on behind to create and pull the images.Podman gives more support with Kubernetes than Docker.</li><li><b>Skopeo</b> is a command line utility that performs various operations on container images and image repositories and it can work with OCI images as well as the original Docker v2 images. This is the backend for Podman, CRI-O, Buildah and friends</li></ul> <br/> Since Podman uses buildah and skopeo as backend, podman can build and run containers. so to get started we can look on Podman.<br/>"

            "value": "Podman can't run containers directly on your mac because containers are really linux. Linux containers cannot run actively on macOS. Due to that we are giving a 'podman machine start' and that starts Linux virtual machine on behind and Podman CLI interacts with the VM. Since VM can't access the host directories it is hard to mount a folder. scp to copy the file will help but it becomes cumbersome during development. The other effective alternative is sshfs via an ssh reverse proxy. This does take some setting up and will need to be repeated each time you update the machine VM for podman. For some of these to work we will need to set up the reverse proxy we intend to use for the sshfs mount, this means that we canâ€™t run the podman machine ssh command to connect. Instead we need to get the unprivileged port ssh is listening on for the VM. This is done using the following command: <br><br><span class='code'>podman machine --log-level=debug ssh -- exit 2>&1 | grep Executing | awk {'print $8'}</span> <br><br><span class='code'>ssh -i ~/.ssh/podman-machine-default -R 10000:$(hostname):22 -p <PORT> core@localhost</span> <br><br><span class='code'>ssh-keygen -t rsa -N \"\" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa</span> <br><br><span class='code'>ssh-copy-id -p 10000 <MAC USERNAME>@127.0.0.1</span><br><br><span class='code'>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/Users</span><br><br><span class='code'>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/Users</span><br><br>Now we have the ability to run the sshfs command and mount the drive across the reverse proxy link.<br><br><span class='code'>sshfs -p 10000 $USER@127.0.0.1:/Users /mnt/Users</span> Now the host mac directories will be visible in mnt directory those can be used to mount in Podman eg: <span class='code'>podman run -d --name mount-test -v /mnt/Users/dalestirling/tmp:/tmp docker.io/library/busybox</span> <br> Others will work same as Docker and no need any alterations to Podman. <br> <br>Happy Coding!!!!:)"
